Jenkins as an automated build tool intergrates with other associated tools such as maven, sonarqube, nexus, nginx, tomcat and GitHub.
This integration between Jenkins and other tools enables Jenkins trigger builds.
Jenkins with integration with other tools, clone codes from the source code manager (Github), then triggers a build with maven where the artifacts or codes are validated, complied by a java class, run unit tests (Junit) and build packages.
